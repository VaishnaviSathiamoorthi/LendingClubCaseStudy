## Objective
Problem Statement:
Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss) for a lending club. The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default
Business Objective:
When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

## Conclusions
*Applicant's source of income needs to be verified and this needs to be an action item
*Loan amount and the annual income amount should be proportional and needs caution on loan amount being sanctioned
*Customers who opt for lower terms might have high installments. customers with high installments tend to default.
*Customers with 10+ years of employment needs to be verified on the age and occupation to understand their repayment capability
